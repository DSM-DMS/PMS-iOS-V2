// Bundle Loader
// 
// Specifies the executable that will load the bundle output file being linked. Undefined
// symbols from the bundle are checked against the specified executable as if it is one
// of the dynamic libraries the bundle was linked with.

// 
// The project-relative path to the property list file that contains the `Info.plist`
// information used by bundles. For details on information property list files, see

// Runpath Search Paths
// 
// This is a list of paths to be added to the `runpath` search path list for the image
// being created. At runtime, `dyld` uses the `runpath` when searching for dylibs whose
// load path begins with `@rpath/`. See [Dynamic Library Programming
// Topics](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/000-Introduction/Introduction.html).

// Product Bundle Identifier
// 
// A string that uniquely identifies the bundle. The string should be in reverse DNS
// format using only alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`), the dot (`.`), and
// the hyphen (`-`). This value is used as the `CFBundleIdentifier` in the `Info.plist`
// of the built bundle.

// Base SDK
// 
// The name or path of the base SDK being used during the build. The product will be
// built against the headers and libraries located inside the indicated SDK. This path
// will be prepended to all search paths, and will be passed through the environment to
// the compiler and linker. Additional SDKs can be specified in the `ADDITIONAL_SDKS`
// setting.

// Targeted Device Families
// 
// The build system uses the selected device to set the correct value for the

// --target-device flag to actool, which determines the idioms selected during catalog
// compilation.

// Test Host
// 
// Path to the executable into which a bundle of tests is injected. Only specify this
// setting if testing an application or other executable.
